Outside Asia, the Awadhi language (A Hindi language)[20] is an official language in Fiji as per the 1997 Constitution of Fiji,[21] where it referred to it as "Hindustani", however in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called "Hindi".[22] It is spoken by 380,000 people in Fiji.[23]

Hindi is also spoken by a large population of Madheshis (people having roots in north-India but have migrated to Nepal over hundreds of years) of Nepal. Apart from specialized vocabulary, Hindi is mutually intelligible with Standard Urdu, another recognized register of Hindustani. Hindi is quite easy to understand for some Pakistanis, who speak Urdu, which, like Hindi, is part of Hindustani. Apart from this, Hindi is spoken by the large Indian diaspora which hails from, or has its origin from the "Hindi Belt" of India. A substantially large North Indian diaspora lives in countries like The United States of America, the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Fiji and Mauritius, where it is natively spoken at home and among their own Hindustani-speaking communities. Outside India, Hindi speakers are 8 million in Nepal; 649,000 in United States of America;[24] 450,170 in Mauritius; 380,000 in Fiji;[23] 250,292 in South Africa; 150,000 in Suriname;[25] 100.00 in Uganda; 45,800 in United Kingdom;[26] 20,000 in New Zealand; 20,000 in Germany; 16,000 in Trinidad and Tobago;[25] 3,000 in Singapore.
